# AuctionGame_GameTheory
This project is an interactive auction game built using Python and Tkinter, a standard GUI library for Python. The game simulates a bidding scenario between two players, where each player competes to win an item by placing bids. The players can choose between different bidding strategies, including random bidding and value-based bidding.
