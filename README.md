# AuctionGame_GameTheory
This project is an interactive auction game built using Python and Tkinter, a standard GUI library for Python. The game simulates a bidding scenario between two players, where each player competes to win an item by placing bids. The players can choose between different bidding strategies, including random bidding and value-based bidding.

Key Features:

Interactive GUI: The game provides a user-friendly graphical interface for inputting player names, values, reserve price, number of rounds, and bidding strategy selection.
Player Customization: Players can customize their names and the values they place on the auctioned item.
Bidding Strategies: The game offers two bidding strategies for players to choose from: random bidding and value-based bidding.
Simulation: The game simulates multiple rounds of bidding based on the specified parameters and displays the results, including average payoffs for each player and the auctioneer.
